		<h1>Design Patterns</h1>
		<p>A design pattern is a reusable program or piece of code that solves a commonly occuring programming problem.</p>
		
		<h2>Singleton</h2>
		<div id="description">
			<p>A Singleton is a design pattern that only allows a single instance of a class to be created. 
			Whenever an instance of a Singleton class is needed, if an instance already exists, the existing instance is used.
			If an instance does not exist, a new instance is created and used.  Singletons are useful because instead of multiple
			objects being created, a single instance is used, using up less memory.</p>
			
			<p>Below is an example of a Singleton used with the Date object to get the current time.  This way, 
				instead of multiple Date objects being created for this trivial purpose, only a single Date object
				is used each time.</p>
			</div>

		<h2>Facade</h2>
		<div id="description">
			<p>The Facade pattern refers to the encapsulation or concealment of some complex body of code by means of 
				a simple, easy to use interface, such as a function.  The Facade pattern helps the programmer to focus 
				more on what needs to be done, instead of how it is being done.</p>
			<p>In my example below, a simple getEmployeeList() function is used to fetch a list of employees and their information, 
				and output it to the screen.  Inside the function, more is going on than the user of the function may realize.  The 
				employee data actually resides inside a JSON file.  The function fetches the JSON file, iterates through each 
				record, and prints each record to the screen.</p>
			</div>
		<div id="employee_list"></div>
		
		<h2>Decorator</h2>
		<div id="description">
			<p>In a Decorator pattern, a developer creates a generic base class containing properties and methods 
				that all instance objects of the class will have.  Later, each instance can have different properties 
				and methods added to them depending on what is needed.  This way, instead of defining a different 
				class for every possible combination of properties/methods, only one class is utlized and each instance 
				is expanded with what it needs.</p>
			<p>In my implementation, I used the situation mentioned in the book of the video game character that 
				can aquire particular items and abilities throughout the game.  Instead of hard-coding the items/weapons/abilities 
				into the player class, which would mean I would have to create a different class each time I wanted another player to have 
				different weapons/abilities, I created a very general base class with properties that every character would have no 
				matter what.  Later, I tacked on or "decorated" the player instance with new properties and methods corresponding to 
				newly acquired weapons and abilities.</p>
			</div>

		<h2>Command</h2>
		<div id="description">
			<p>The Command design pattern enables a developer to parameterize method calls so that they don't have to 
				invoke the methods directly. The book describes the Command pattern as an encapsulation of method invocation, requests, 
				or operations into a single object, enabling us to decouple objects invoking the action from the objects which implement them. 
				Unfortunately I found this latter description vague and the example given in the book did not fully demonstrate exactly what 
				the author means by this. All I see is method calls being passed as arguments to an execute() method, which I still found to be 
				interesting and useful in itself.</p>
			<p>In my implementation, I altered the example object given in the book into a simple calculator object.  Here, instead of invoking an 
				arithmetic method directly by means of Calculator.add(), and the like, the developer uses the Calculator.execute() for all method 
				calls, passing the method name, and the two numeric operands to be added, subtracted, multiplied, etc, as the first, second, and third 
				arguments, respectively. </p>
			</div>
		<div id="command_output"></div>
		
		<h2>Iterator</h2>
		<div id="description">
			<p>An Iterator is a design pattern that allows us to traverse through all of the elements of a collection, such as an array 
				or object, and perform some operation on or with each element.</p>
			<p>Below, I created my own Iterator that can traverse through the elements/properties of an array/object and, if the value 
				of an element/property is a string, changes all the letters to uppercase or lowercase.  The first parameter of my function 
				specifies the desired letter case and can be set to "upper" or "lower", and the second parameter is the array or object that 
				has the strings to be converted.</p>
			</div>
		<div id="iterator_output"></div>
		
		<h2>Constructor</h2>
		<div id="description">
			<p>The Constructor pattern is a special method that allows the developer to initialize a new instance of an object class.  The 
				constructor can accept arguments that can be used to initialize the properties and methods of the new object.</p>
			<p>I admit, I shamelessly took the easy way out with this one, mainly because I had trouble following along with and implementing 
				some of the other Creational design patterns.  Anyway, I created my own constructor of an Atom class which can be initialized using 
				the constructor arguments with the numbers of electrons, protons, and neutrons it has, including the name of the element.</p>
