		<h1>Design Patterns</h1>
		<p>A design pattern is a reusable program or piece of code that solves a commonly occuring programming problem.</p>
		
		<h2>Singleton</h2>
		<div id="description">
			<p>A Singleton is a design pattern that only allows a single instance of a class to be created. 
			Whenever an instance of a Singleton class is needed, if an instance already exists, the existing instance is used.
			If an instance does not exist, a new instance is created and used.  Singletons are useful because instead of multiple
			objects being created, a single instance is used, using up less memory.</p>
			
			<p>Below is an example of a Singleton used with the Date object to get the current time.  This way, 
				instead of multiple Date objects being created for this trivial purpose, only a single Date object
				is used each time.</p>
			</div>
		<div id="singleton_output"></div>
		
		
		<h2>Facade</h2>
		<div id="description">
			<p>The Facade pattern refers to the encapsulation or concealment of some complex body of code by means of 
				a simple, easy to use interface, such as a function.  The Facade pattern helps the programmer to focus 
				more on what needs to be done, instead of how it is being done.</p>
			<p>In my example below, a simple getEmployeeList() function is used to fetch a list of employees and their information, 
				and output it to the screen.  Inside the function, more is going on than the user of the function may realize.  The 
				employee data actually resides inside a JSON file.  The function fetches the JSON file, iterates through each 
				record, and prints each record to the screen.</p>
			</div>
